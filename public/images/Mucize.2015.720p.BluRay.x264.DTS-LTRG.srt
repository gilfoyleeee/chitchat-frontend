00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:21,100
The Miracle

2
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:24,340
Based on a True Story

3
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,219
Bagels!

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,620
Crispy bagels!

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,180
Bagels, bagels!
-Hello. Welcome.

6
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,820
Crispy bagels!

7
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,180
Hey! Come back here!

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,860
Sister? Can we buy balloons?

9
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,180
Yes, we can.

10
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,020
-Can you give us a balloon?
-Sure.

11
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,820
Here you go.

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,859
Ice cream!

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,139
-Hello, kids.
-Ice cream.

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,460
-One scoop or two?
-One.

15
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,860
Thank you.

16
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,500
Mahir, are you really going to turn
your back on your family and leave?

17
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,340
You know why.
My hands are tied.

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,300
Mahir, are you trying to bury me alive?
God damn you!

19
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,740
What about all the promises you made
before we got married?

20
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,220
"Cemile,
I will never leave you alone."

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,140
"Cemile,
you will always be by my side."

22
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,340
"I can't live without you."

23
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,060
What about all that?

24
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:32,459
Cemile, please don't. This is my job.
How else am I going to make a living?

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,220
Let's take the girls and go.

26
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,220
-What are you talking about?
-I'm saying we should leave this place.

27
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,100
Do you want me to take the kids
and go with you? Are you nuts?

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,059
Girls, go in the other room.
Go on.

29
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,580
Go set the table.

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,060
Cemile, this would be an opportunity
for the girls to see a different place.

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,460
And you can have
a change of scenery.

32
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,020
That place is a part of our country.
What's wrong with that?

33
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:59,780
Have you completely lost your mind?

34
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,500
What am I going to do
in some remote mountain village?

35
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,700
What am I going to do there?
I'd rather die than go there.

36
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,299
And you shouldn't go either.
You should quit your job too.

37
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,819
You can work for my father.
He'll take care of you.

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,539
You haven't stopped talking about
your father for years!

39
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,900
Do I need your father's money?

40
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,780
Look at me, don't go.

41
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,539
Look, look at your husband.
I am a teacher, a civil servant.

42
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,900
Those kids over there need me too.

43
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,300
Also, this is all your father's fault.

44
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,500
If he hadn't pulled strings for me
to stay here,...

45
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,059
...I could have finished my duty
in the East years ago.

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,139
Good God...

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,940
Even at this age, I must go.
There are soldiers.

48
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,580
If I don't go,
they won't give me my pension, Cemile.

49
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,660
Mahir Y
lmaz, do whatever you want.

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,180
Mahir!
-Cemile!

51
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,140
Take good care of yourself
and the girls, okay?

52
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,660
You'll always be on my mind, Mahir.
You know that, right?

53
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,139
I do.

54
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,459
A woman's place is beside her man,
but I can't leave the kids.

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,100
Mahir...
-Yes?

56
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,340
I heard there are bandits there.
Take care of yourself.

57
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,660
Don't worry.
Don't be afraid, Cemile.

58
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,100
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

59
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,900
-Goodbye.
-Be safe.

60
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,180
-Take care.
-Have a safe trip, Mahir.

61
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,219
-Goodbye, teacher.
-Don't forget to write us.

62
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,339
-Watch out for the bandits.
-Have a safe trip.

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,099
Father!
Take good care of them!

64
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,860
-Have a safe trip.
-Take good care of yourself.

65
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,339
-Go with God.
-Have a nice trip.

66
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,739
I hope you'll see each other soon.
Let's go.

67
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,339
Sir, this is the last stop.

68
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,859
But where is the village?

69
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,300
The government
only built the road up to here.

70
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,459
You'll have to go the rest of the way
on foot.

71
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,859
Well, how am I supposed to
get to the village then?

72
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,540
-Do you see that mountain over there?
-Yes.

73
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,780
You are going to cross that.

74
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,660
After that,
you are going to cross another mountain.

75
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,700
A stranger is coming.

76
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,900
Who is it?

77
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,300
Tell everyone.

78
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,259
Get everybody ready.

79
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,339
Hands up!

80
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,100
-Hands up!
-Do not move!

81
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,740
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Do not move an inch!

82
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,579
-Who are you?
-Speak!

83
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,620
I'm the teacher.

84
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,859
So, you are the teacher.

85
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,660
Move out of the way, move.

86
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,820
-Who did you say you were?
-I said I was the teacher.

87
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:14,060
-I'm not mishearing, am I?
-No.

88
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,140
He really is the teacher.

89
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,459
Mister teacher,
you are going to teach in Zazaki, right?

90
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,540
-In what?
-Zazaki.

91
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,620
Teacher, sir, welcome.
We are happy to see you.

92
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,219
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

93
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,260
Thank you.

94
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,100
Excuse me,
where is the school?

95
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,020
The school?

96
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,979
My good sir, the government
has sent the teacher,...

97
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,660
...but hasn't thought of
building the school, is that so?

98
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,380
What do you mean? You don't
have a school in the village?

99
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,180
No.

100
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:03,580
The government never makes mistakes.
How could this happen?

101
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,540
It happens, my friend.
It happens.

102
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,540
Hey, all!
-Yeah?

103
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,339
-Do we have a teacher now?
-Yeah.

104
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,859
So, we'll probably get
a school as well.

105
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,900
We'll also get
roads, water and electricity.

106
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,739
We'll even get radio.

107
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,539
You are a little bit late,
but it figures,...

108
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,459
...your government
had long forgotten about us.

109
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,940
-Come on, this way.
-Please, don't bother.

110
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,940
They'll carry your luggage.
Come on.

111
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,340
Come on, my house is over there.

112
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,900
What are you doing?
Don't make me come over there!

113
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,659
Come on.

114
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,699
Leave Aziz alone!

115
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,940
Crazy, crazy,
Aziz the Cripple is crazy.

116
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:52,739
I'm from the Aegean, from Izmir.

117
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,259
I'm married,
and I have two daughters.

118
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,500
God bless them all.

119
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,659
I have six sons, myself.

120
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,020
I have daughters as well,
but they don't count.

121
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,059
-Why don't they count?
-Why should they?

122
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,419
We raise them, care for them,
and they go away.

123
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,020
Then, they belong to somebody else.

124
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,780
If the government builds a school,
you wouldn't send the girls?

125
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,900
No.

126
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,019
Sir, speaking of the school...
What are we going to do about that?

127
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,580
I need to report
to the director of education...

128
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,939
...that there is no school
in this village.

129
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,820
We'll go to the town hall tomorrow
and tell him about our predicament.

130
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,780
Our government
sent a teacher here,...

131
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,900
...that means it will build
a school as well.

132
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,179
It's as simple as that.

133
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,260
You can't go to the town hall
tomorrow.

134
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,139
The bus comes
only once every three days.

135
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,820
-What do you mean? Really?
-Yeah.

136
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:48,620
Sir, it took them 30 years
to send you.

137
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,300
If we depend on the government,...

138
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,940
...it would take them another
30 years to build the school.

139
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,420
So, where will I teach the kids
without a school?

140
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,940
Would a makeshift place
in the village help, sir?

141
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:04,499
-What kind of place?
-We've all got barns.

142
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,059
My dad's right.

143
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,380
We could take out the animals
and bring in the kids.

144
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,180
That's not possible.
Kids are not animals.

145
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,220
There's no way
you can turn a barn into a school.

146
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,019
The government
will build the school.

147
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,659
Tomorrow is another day, chief.

148
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,140
Teacher, your arrival
has made me really,...

149
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,859
...really happy.

150
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,340
Tomorrow, I want all single men
to be ready and wait for me outside.

151
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,739
God bless you, father.

152
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,900
Dear God,
you are the Almighty.

153
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,979
Thank you for sending me
to a village without a school.

154
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,859
I swear,
I will make a sacrifice...

155
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,940
...if you also let me go back home
safe and sound.

156
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,580
Amen.

157
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,900
God, grant me patience...

158
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,500
What's this?
-It is a talus bone.

159
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,979
Son, you never give that away.

160
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,100
That means they like you.

161
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,419
Thank you, son.

162
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,740
Those who would like to get married
this year, step forward.

163
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,180
When it's work,
they avoid it,...

164
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,100
...when it's women,
they race each other for it.

165
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,300
I'll show you!

166
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,419
Which one of you is the oldest?

167
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,099
Look at Aziz. He becomes a different man
when he hears anything about women.

168
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,259
Aziz...

169
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,819
Hazar. Head out immediately
and find a girl for Celal.

170
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,219
-Thank you, father.
-Okay.

171
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,100
Bless you.

172
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,620
Look, Celal's going too!

173
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,420
Mother! Mother!

174
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,259
Wait, Mr. Charming is coming!

175
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,180
Celal, run, brother, run! Make sure
your mother doesn't pick an ugly one!

176
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:39,659
Celal, don't forget to check her teeth!

177
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,380
What's going on, son?

178
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,620
Mother, please
take a good look at the girl.

179
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,740
If possible, please make sure
she has no moustache and no beard.

180
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,459
Mother, I'm begging you,
please make sure she looks good...

181
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,260
...with golden hair, perfect teeth,
big boobs, a slim waist...

182
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,700
...and a nice butt.

183
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,899
Celal, watch your mouth!
Shame on you!

184
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,259
Celal, don't you have anything to do?
Let us go.

185
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,819
Mother,
please take a good look at her teeth.

186
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,579
You know,
it's the most important thing for me.

187
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,500
And I don't want her to be short
like this lady here.

188
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:21,740
-Good God.
-Celal, stop getting on my nerves.

189
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,739
First, take a look at your ugly face
in the mirror, then talk.

190
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,539
-That's enough.
-Come on, let's go.

191
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,660
Celal, we should get...

192
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:37,139
Aziz, Aziz...
Go on, go home, son.

193
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,339
Go, go.

194
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,660
Alright mother,
we'll be awaiting your return.

195
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,619
Aziz.

196
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Aziz, stop. Stop.

197
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,460
Aziz, they'll come back.

198
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,260
Let's go home.
They'll come back.

199
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,539
Celal! Did you let her know?
A slim waist and a good set of teeth.

200
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,179
Celal, did you tell her
that you don't want a moustache?

201
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,900
I did.

202
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,580
Celal, you are going to have to make do
just like the rest of us.

203
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,780
Your mother is going to pick someone
suitable for her own taste.

204
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,780
You'll see,
my mother will bring me a gorgeous girl.

205
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,380
Which is obviously what I deserve.

206
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,579
Tell me, who is the most handsome,
the most charming guy in this village?

207
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,379
What?

208
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,780
Mr. Charming,
to hell with your charm!

209
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,620
Celal, you look just like
my hairy behind.

210
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:30,179
He's right.

211
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,699
Aren't you embarrassed
to say things like that?

212
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,380
Shame on you.

213
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,060
-Welcome, how are you?
-We are fine.

214
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,219
That's good.
She doesn't have bad breath.

215
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,579
Sit down, dear.

216
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,500
She has a nice body.

217
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:28,220
Dear, tell us from The Quran...
-Al-Baqarah.

218
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,020
Tell us the name of the
255th verse of Surah Al-Baqarah.

219
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:38,219
It's Ayatul Kursi.

220
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,499
Good God.

221
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,500
Recite it to me.

222
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,860
Alright, alright.

223
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,300
About cooking...

224
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,099
-How to cook beans, tell us that.
-Yes.

225
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,819
First, you soak the beans in water
the night before.

226
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,100
And then?

227
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:14,459
The next day,
you boil them in a pot full of water.

228
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,699
Then, you add onions,
meat, tomato paste, butter,...

229
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,619
...and just a little salt.

230
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,900
It will be ready in two hours.
And enjoy.

231
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,700
Thank you.

232
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,260
Well said, my dear.

233
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,859
Now, stand up. Walk.

234
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,380
She looks a bit chubby.

235
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,620
Yes. And she's very tall.

236
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,860
Wonderful.

237
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:45,779
She's not even bow-legged.
She's perfectly gracious.

238
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,260
Stand in front of me.

239
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,660
She has wide hips.
She'll be good at carrying babies.

240
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,220
Indeed.

241
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,620
She'll give birth easily.

242
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,100
Drink some water
and lift your head.

243
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,100
She doesn't have goitre either.

244
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,140
How are you?

245
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,300
I'm fine.

246
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,580
Go ahead, open your mouth.

247
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,060
Don't worry.
Open your mouth. It'll be fine.

248
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,620
Her mouth is full of cavities.

249
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,060
But she has good knowledge of The Quran,
and she knows how to cook, right?

250
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:48,220
She is our girl.
Congratulations to everyone.

251
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,580
Thank you.

252
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,980
Go on, take a seat.

253
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:57,059
Gule is now our bride-to-be.

254
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,860
Okay?
-Okay.

255
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,339
We wonder what the groom is like.

256
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:14,540
The groom is a dark, handsome man
with broad shoulders and hazel eyes.

257
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,140
He's the most handsome man
in the village.

258
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,820
The groom is really strong.

259
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:22,220
He's undefeatable in wrestling.

260
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,740
He's a very religious person.

261
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:29,579
I assure you, there is
no one else like him in these lands.

262
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,900
God bless him.
-God bless him.

263
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,420
-Celal.
-Here.

264
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,060
Celal...
You've really lucked out.

265
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:28,900
My wife
won't stop talking about the girl.

266
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,619
Bozat, what does she look like?

267
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,459
My wife said, "I have never seen
a beauty like that in all my life."

268
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,419
-Really?
-Yeah.

269
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,379
-Celal, she has perfect hair.
-She has teeth like pearls.

270
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,419
-She has a perfect waist.
-She's very slender.

271
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,059
She's a gazelle.

272
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,580
Oh, man...

273
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,220
I hope her heart is just as beautiful.
-We hope so too.

274
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,300
-Guys...
-Yeah?

275
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,420
-What if she's evil-hearted?
-Not possible.

276
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,380
Let's go. Come on.

277
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,660
Come on, come on.

278
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,459
Look, do this right
and don't embarrass us, alright?

279
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,739
Thank you very much
for everything.

280
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,980
Do I have your blessings?
-Yes!

281
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,500
Hey! Stop it!

282
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,300
Welcome.

283
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:13,820
Thank you.

284
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,620
My name is Celal.

285
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,380
But everyone in the village calls me
"Mr. Charming".

286
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,140
"Who" is your name?

287
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:29,540
My name is Gulten,
but they call me "Gule".

288
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,500
Oh, you talk so sweetly...

289
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,379
Let me lift this up
and see your beauty.

290
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,020
Good God...

291
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,820
How are you?

292
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,140
How are you?

293
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,139
Very well.

294
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,579
Let me put out the light.

295
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,220
God damn it...

296
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,780
Aziz!
Aziz, where are you going, Aziz?

297
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:34,900
Celal, how wonderful.

298
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:38,099
Father! Aziz is coming after you!

299
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,380
Come now,
go back to the village.

300
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,460
Oh, son...

301
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,019
I wish I could know
what you are saying. I wish...

302
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,740
Aziz...

303
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,460
Father, you go ahead.
Aziz, take it easy.

304
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,380
Come on, brother.
Aziz, come on.

305
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,340
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

306
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,380
He always does the same thing.

307
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,140
Whenever I set out to go somewhere,
he comes after me.

308
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,499
He thinks I won't come back.

309
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,660
-What's wrong with him?
-We don't know.

310
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,659
-Didn't you take him to a doctor?
-We did.

311
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,580
We took him to doctors,
hodjas, sheikhs,...

312
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,860
...but we couldn't find a remedy.

313
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,780
He hasn't talked to me even once,
but he talks to his horse every day.

314
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,780
Oh, God! Oh, God!

315
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,940
The bandits!

316
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,660
Sir? Who are they?

317
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,420
Don't be afraid, teacher.
These are our boys.

318
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,459
What do you mean?

319
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,099
Hello.

320
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,260
How are you?
-Thank you, we are alright.

321
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,699
How is Cemilo?
-He's doing great.

322
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,099
-Wish him well.
-I will.

323
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,860
Come on, let's move.

324
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,660
-Good luck.
-Let's go.

325
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,299
They are bandits, aren't they?

326
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,620
They call them "bandits", but in fact,
they are the lions of the mountains.

327
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,219
But they shoot,
and they have guns!

328
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:08,380
That's right, but they don't
hassle people. They don't steal.

329
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,260
They are the owners of
these mountains,...

330
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,060
...masters of the animals.

331
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,859
Come on, let's go.

332
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,860
Gentlemen,
the situation is obvious.

333
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,100
As you know,
we are under martial law.

334
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,220
There's nothing we can do.

335
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,220
The country is going through
a very delicate period.

336
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,459
There is no school
in the village I was appointed to.

337
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,060
Where will I teach the kids?
How will we solve this, director?

338
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,259
Look, maybe
I didn't make myself clear enough.

339
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,019
Two days ago,...

340
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,260
...Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and
his colleagues were executed...

341
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,060
...by the military.

342
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,740
-What do you mean?
-Be quiet, walls have ears.

343
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,620
Ankara is in chaos.
All hell is breaking loose.

344
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:07,700
With the grace of God,
our glorious military,...

345
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,380
...will bring
a new order to our country.

346
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,380
By the way, sir,
I have some advice for you.

347
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,220
It would be for the best...

348
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,019
...if you cited the absence
of a school as an excuse and...

349
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,220
...went back home.

350
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,420
They say
every dark cloud has a silver lining.

351
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:51,380
Don't be sad.
It wasn't meant to be.

352
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:55,100
I'm sad to be leaving too,
but there's nothing I can do.

353
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:58,139
Damn this poverty, sir.

354
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,779
Oh, how the kids' eyes sparkled
when they saw you...

355
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,460
How are we going to tell them
that our teacher is leaving?

356
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,500
Haydar...

357
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,060
I must go.

358
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,940
What will you do?

359
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,420
We'll go to the terminal
and wait for the bus.

360
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,060
We'll come see you off tomorrow, sir.

361
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,900
Alright.

362
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:25,300
Extra!

363
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,379
President Menderes was hung!
Read all about it!

364
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,500
Extra!

365
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,780
Hello.

366
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,500
Hello, sir.

367
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,299
-I hope everything's okay.
-Everything's fine.

368
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,860
Do you want me to stay?
-Yeah.

369
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,739
-I have one condition.
-God help us.

370
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:27,779
I'll stay if you let girls study
as well. Do you accept?

371
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,540
Accepted!

372
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,140
Hello?

373
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,940
Cemile, can you hear me?

374
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,739
This is Mahir!

375
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:55,979
Now, listen to me very carefully!
I'm in deep trouble!

376
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,739
On the way to the village,
I was taken hostage by bandits!

377
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,940
I have a gun held to my head
right now, Cemile!

378
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,980
Hush!

379
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:15,700
Cemile,
you must send me 2000 Liras!

380
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,420
Otherwise, neither my daughters
nor you will never see me again!

381
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,619
How should I know?

382
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,180
They said "2000"!
That's what they want!

383
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,779
If you want,
you can talk to them yourself!

384
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,140
Cemile, don't go to the police
or the gendarmerie.

385
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:36,620
My daughters and you
will never see me again.

386
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:40,139
If you don't want your daughters
to grow up without a father,...

387
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,420
...if you don't want to be a widow,
send the money right away!

388
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,179
I'm waiting!

389
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Here you are.

390
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,579
-Hello, chief.
-Hello.

391
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,820
-Hello, Haydar.
-Hello.

392
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Chief,
we'll build a school in the village.

393
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,740
Here's the money
for the cement and the iron.

394
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,540
Chief, Cemilo said
to wish you well.

395
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,140
We're here to build the school!

396
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,580
-Welcome!
-Thank you!

397
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,900
If someone heard that the bandits
were building the school,...

398
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,619
...I would be jailed for treason.

399
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,060
My career would be over.
I would lose my retirement.

400
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,380
Sir, these men are competent.

401
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,860
They know their cement.
Don't you worry.

402
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:24,419
Listen, chief, I swear,
if they prosecute me,...

403
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,580
...I'll deny knowing
any of these people, understood?

404
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,219
Yeah!

405
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,580
Come on, people.
Let's get to it.

406
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:32,900
Come on.

407
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,740
Aziz!

408
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,299
Aziz.

409
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,819
Aziz.

410
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,020
Aziz, behave yourself!
Stop getting on my nerves!

411
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,219
Come on.

412
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,379
Hold on, son.

413
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
Aziz?

414
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,380
Aziz!

415
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:26,060
Aziz!

416
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,499
Aziz!

417
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,060
Knock it off!

418
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,740
-Have you seen Aziz?
-Yeah, he went that way.

419
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,980
Let's go.

420
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,180
Aziz, what are you doing?

421
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:07,180
God damn you!

422
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,420
-Aziz!
-Aziz!

423
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,140
Stop!

424
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,700
How many times have we told you
not to run around naked in the village?

425
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,860
Cover yourself!
You are a disgrace!

426
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,220
Aziz! If you go out like this again,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

427
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,100
Shut up!

428
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:34,420
Calm down, boy.

429
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,859
Enough, Aziz. Aziz!

430
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:43,780
Stop!

431
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,420
Calm down, please.

432
00:42:40,499 --> 00:42:43,580
-See you, chief.
-Thank you.

433
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:46,660
God bless you.
-Amen!

434
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,860
Amen.

435
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,980
Godspeed.
Send my greetings to Cemilo.

436
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,460
We will!

437
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:54,380
Let's go!

438
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:57,580
Good luck!

439
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,099
Let's go.

440
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,820
Distinguished parents,
dear students,...

441
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:18,179
...our esteemed chief and Haydar.
To all, welcome!

442
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,780
Thank you.

443
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:28,580
I salute you with respect and love,...

444
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:33,580
...and I'm very excited for all of you
to start your education!

445
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,020
Dear villagers,...

446
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,460
...now, I invite you
to take a moment of silence...

447
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:50,140
...to honour the memory of our first
teacher, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,...

448
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:57,020
...our men who gave their lives
to defend our country...

449
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:02,900
...and all theachers
who have been laid to rest.

450
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,859
-What is he saying?
-I have no idea.

451
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,619
Why one moment?

452
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,820
-I beg your pardon?
-Why does it take just a moment?

453
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,139
Well, I don't know.

454
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,540
We are all going to be silent
for a moment.

455
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,060
When someone dies, we mourn for 40 days.
What do you mean, "a moment"?

456
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,060
It's not appropriate.

457
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,299
Celal is right.

458
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,780
Alright then.

459
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:35,020
Haydar and our dear chief,
I invite you to cut the ribbon.

460
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:36,580
Come on.

461
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,940
Chief.

462
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,220
Yes, friends.
Congratulations to our new school.

463
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,020
Bravo!

464
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,100
Hold on now.

465
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,379
Kids, come on.
We have a lesson to do. Come on in.

466
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:06,059
Come on, there you go.
Easy.

467
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,500
Come on in.
Allow the others to pass.

468
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,060
Chief, come on in
and take a look.

469
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,660
Come on. Come in.

470
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,780
It's very beautiful.
Congratulations.

471
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,099
Kids, easy.

472
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,820
Chief, Haydar,
thank you for everything.

473
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,299
Come on, Haydar.

474
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,699
Come on, everyone,
sit down.

475
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,900
Nice...

476
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,659
What are you doing?
Go to your seat.

477
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,859
Alright, children.
This is our first day of class.

478
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,300
But before we start,
let me tell you this:

479
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,219
I am your teacher.

480
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:10,100
My name is Mahir,
and my last name is Yilmaz.

481
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,100
You gave this to me, remember?

482
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,659
What's your name?

483
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,299
What's his name?

484
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,619
He's Cemilo's son.
His name is Gafur Elci.

485
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:34,619
Gafur, huh?

486
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,060
Dear God!

487
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,339
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

488
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,620
Oh, welcome, guys.

489
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,259
-Evening. We brought you some food.
-Thank you. Come on in.

490
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,699
Come in.

491
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,500
Aziz! Aziz!

492
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:47,780
Aziz, come on in.
You'll get wet. You'll get sick.

493
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,820
Have a seat, let's talk.
-Thank you.

494
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:27,860
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

495
00:48:27,899 --> 00:48:31,780
So, Celal, how is marriage?

496
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,820
He never leaves the house!

497
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,060
Sir, how are we going to learn
how to read and write?

498
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,660
By "we", I mean the others.
I'm literate, myself.

499
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,820
I already know
how to read and write.

500
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,579
Celal, the school is open
to everyone,...

501
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,420
...but the children
are our priority.

502
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,500
Where did you study?

503
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,979
I went to school downtown.

504
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,259
I thought you only completed
the second grade.

505
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,340
He's so ignorant!

506
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,980
I'm a bit of a rebel.
I like traveling.

507
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:13,540
I thought traveling
would give me more knowledge,...

508
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,659
...which is why, I left school.

509
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,140
Where did you travel?

510
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,620
I went downtown two or three times.

511
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,860
We should go now.

512
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,699
-Thank you for coming.
-Thanks.

513
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,580
Celal, I want to ask you something:

514
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,899
Why did Cemilo
run away to the mountains?

515
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,820
Once, there was a man called Kaso.

516
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,420
He whipped our father's feet
in front of everyone.

517
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,660
Cemilo wouldn't stand it and
shot Kaso right between the eyes.

518
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:47,540
He ran away to the mountains
to avoid jailtime.

519
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,460
I see...

520
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,580
-Well, then, sleep tight.
-Thank you. See you.

521
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,619
Have a nice evening.

522
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:03,059
Aziz, let's go home. It's cold outside.
You'll get sick.

523
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,220
Come on.

524
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:08,180
Aziz, let's go home. It's raining.
You'll get sick.

525
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,900
Kids!

526
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:47,860
Kids! What are you doing?

527
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,660
You should not behave this way.

528
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,700
I don't want to see you
picking on Aziz anymore.

529
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:57,460
If you don't listen to me, you can
forget about candies, biscuits and me.

530
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,540
And I won't let you in school.
Understood?

531
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:00,980
Yeah.

532
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,140
Aziz?

533
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,460
The kids won't pick on you anymore.

534
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,100
Isn't that right?
-Yeah!

535
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,300
That's good.

536
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,180
Go now. You need to study.
Come on, move it.

537
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,700
Thank you, sir.

538
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,899
Don't mention it, chief.

539
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:49,220
Aziz?

540
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,019
Aziz?

541
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,179
Come.

542
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:45,340
Aziz?
What are you doing here?

543
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,100
Come on in.

544
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,980
Do you want me to
open the door?

545
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,980
Come inside.

546
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:54,740
I don't understand
what's going on with Aziz.

547
00:53:54,779 --> 00:53:58,100
Something came over him.
He has never been like this before.

548
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:01,499
Maybe he feels lonely because
the kids started going to school.

549
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,220
Aziz!
Where are you going, Aziz?

550
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:05,339
Let's go.

551
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,739
Alright, kids.
Now, we'll write the letter "G".

552
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,259
Write it down.

553
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,219
Well done. Nice.

554
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,259
Write it down.
Open your notebook. Write it down.

555
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,740
You too.

556
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,180
Write it down.
Come on.

557
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,300
Look, here.

558
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:18,940
Aziz?

559
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:24,220
Aziz?

560
00:55:25,379 --> 00:55:28,979
Semo, Feyzo! Have you seen Aziz?
-No.

561
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,460
Where is Aziz?

562
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,100
Aziz!

563
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,979
Guys! Guys!

564
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,180
What's wrong, mother?

565
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,579
Aziz's horse has come home without him.
Where is Aziz?

566
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,660
That's right.
I haven't seen him for hours.

567
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,620
Come on, let's look for him.

568
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,339
Hang on, you are almost there.

569
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,100
-Hang on.
-Pull!

570
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:11,740
Here we go...

571
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,180
Have you seen Aziz?
-No.

572
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:15,940
Aziz is missing,
you go and look for him too.

573
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,500
He's missing?
Let's go.

574
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,700
Aziz!

575
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,939
Aziz!

576
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,820
Aziz!

577
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,980
-Have you seen Aziz?
-No.

578
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:40,540
Aziz!

579
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,979
Aziz!

580
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,139
Aziz!

581
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,700
Aziz!

582
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,020
Aziz!

583
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,100
Father! Father! Aziz...
Father! Father!

584
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,820
Father, Aziz...

585
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,780
Look at what I'm drawing.

586
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:13,220
And another one...

587
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,460
See, Aziz?
You draw like this...

588
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,619
Kids! Kids!

589
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,740
We've talked about this.
You won't pick on Aziz anymore.

590
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,739
Listen to me quietly!

591
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:34,379
Look, kids, Aziz will be
in this classroom from now on.

592
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,740
I assigned him as the class president.
Understood?

593
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,780
Go on, off you go.

594
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,140
Everyone will do their homework
at home!

595
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:50,620
The street vendor is here!

596
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:59,420
Aziz, we'll study together.
We'll draw in the notebook.

597
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:04,499
Aziz, listen.
My name is Mahir.

598
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,139
"My name is Mahir."

599
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:10,220
Your name is Aziz.

600
00:58:10,259 --> 00:58:13,139
"Your name is Aziz."

601
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,260
Okay?

602
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,460
Let's draw something here.
Here, take the pencil.

603
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,220
It's your turn now.
You are going to draw.

604
00:58:22,259 --> 00:58:23,980
Come on,
you are going to draw like this.

605
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,619
Hold the pencil like this.
And now, draw like this...

606
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,740
What do you think?
Come on, draw. Draw.

607
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:36,020
Draw, draw.
Don't be afraid.

608
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:41,620
Well done, Aziz!
You'll do this! Nice.

609
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,700
Come on, one more.
You shouldn't let go of the pencil.

610
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,579
Haydar...

611
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,420
Did you see Aziz?

612
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:55,300
Thank God...

613
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:59,260
Did you see how he was drawing?

614
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,780
Dad, do you think
the teacher is a sheik?

615
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:05,780
He did what no sheik could do.

616
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,340
Father, this teacher is
an amazing person.

617
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,980
Even sheiks are not blessed
the way he is.

618
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,860
Maybe we should bring my wife
to see him.

619
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:20,140
Maybe he'll make her better.
Maybe I'll have children.

620
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,940
Good God!
Give me patience!

621
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,460
You are a student now. You will be
coming to school every day.

622
01:00:16,499 --> 01:00:18,659
Come on.
Let me take you home.

623
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,099
Aziz.

624
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,619
Aziz, come on.

625
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,219
-Aziz, you go to school now, huh?
-Well done!

626
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,740
Well done!

627
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,620
Aziz, this notebook is yours.

628
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:51,260
You are going to draw something
tonight. Don't forget. Now, go.

629
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:55,259
-Come on, let's go home.
-Come on, Aziz.

630
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,499
-Attaboy! Tell us what you did.
-Good evening, sir.

631
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,140
Good job, Aziz. Good job.

632
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:04,859
Chief, Aziz is going to stay with me
every now and then.

633
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,580
He'll keep me company,...

634
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:10,540
...and I will teach him
whatever he needs to know.

635
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,939
Alright.

636
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,900
You'd better be prepared, sir.
It will snow soon.

637
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,220
When the snow comes,
the village turns into a prison.

638
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,900
Everybody surrenders to God.

639
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:30,179
For eight months, we depend on God,
for four months, on the government.

640
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,100
If you'd like to write a letter,
write it now.

641
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:37,060
It would take eight months
to get an answer.

642
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,380
Really?

643
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,060
Then, I'll write a letter right away.
-Godspeed.

644
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:59,339
He writes beautifully,
like a first class civil servant.

645
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,859
Aziz has already started writing.

646
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,420
I could teach you also, if you want,
you could write as well.

647
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:06,620
You?

648
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:12,100
You went to school for two years
and didn't learn a thing.

649
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,580
You ugly cow.
-I resent that.

650
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:19,780
Since Aziz has started writing,
his wildness has subdued.

651
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,060
You know what they say:

652
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,699
If you are educated and wise...

653
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,940
He writes beautifully.

654
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:47,300
Don't squeeze your fist. Easy.
Calm down. Let's try this.

655
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:49,900
It's going to be fine.
Hold it.

656
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:56,219
This is called gymnastics, Aziz.
We will workout our arms, okay?

657
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,619
Come here, don't go. Come.
Stretch your arm slowly.

658
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,100
Easy.

659
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,220
Okay. You do this arm by yourself.
Raise your arm.

660
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:09,899
Raise it like this.
Raise your arm.

661
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,340
Well done, Aziz. Nice.
Relax.

662
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:18,020
Look at Aziz.
This teacher is an angel.

663
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:20,380
Don't be scared, Aziz.
It won't hurt.

664
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:23,339
God bless the teacher.

665
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,220
Thank God.

666
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:29,459
Alright, alright.
Like this.

667
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:35,819
Aziz?

668
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,979
You know what? You accomplished a lot
in a very short time.

669
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,900
Carry on.

670
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,979
Write.

671
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,980
Father, don't worry about Aziz.
He's doing fine.

672
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:12,179
Let's get back inside.
It's cold out here.

673
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:17,219
-Listen to me, son...
-Father?

674
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:21,580
Some people have eyes
in their hearts.

675
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,059
They see the world
through those eyes.

676
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,059
They see everything
through those eyes.

677
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:38,819
May God always guide you all
towards kind-hearted people.

678
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:42,020
Amen, father. Amen.

679
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,740
What is it, Aziz?

680
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,459
Is something wrong?

681
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,620
It snowed!

682
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,419
Aziz, you know what?
It never snows in my hometown.

683
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,300
Chief! It snowed!

684
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:40,340
-Will you have lessons?
-We will.

685
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,300
The kids will be here.

686
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:49,940
Kids!
Everybody to school!

687
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,539
Aziz, what are you doing?

688
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,859
Everybody to school!

689
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,940
Everybody to school!

690
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:14,900
You'll get cold, Aziz.

691
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,819
Gafur, go sit down.

692
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:45,140
Hilmi?
Did you move the animals?

693
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:47,020
Yes, I did.
They are "sitting" at home now.

694
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:51,340
Did you have breakfast
with them as well?

695
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,699
Sit down.

696
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:58,300
Filiz?
Read what's written on the board.

697
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,219
-"Ayse jumps rope!"
-Well done. What's that again?

698
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,220
"Ayse jumps rope!"

699
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:06,179
Nice. Now write it down.

700
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,739
"Ayse jumps rope!"

701
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,460
Cemilo is here!

702
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,540
Mother, come!

703
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,540
Cemilo is coming!

704
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:58,660
Cemilo is here!

705
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:11,180
Look, your husband is here.
Congratulations.

706
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,739
-Father?
-Welcome, son.

707
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,340
Thank you.

708
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,620
Mother, how are you?
-I'm fine, my son. Welcome.

709
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,540
Cemilo... Welcome.

710
01:09:36,059 --> 01:09:41,260
-How are you all?
-We're fine. Welcome, Cemilo.

711
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:46,180
Father, where is my son?

712
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,859
Come,
let me take you to him.

713
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,300
Everybody, look at me.
Look at me.

714
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,779
Look at me.

715
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:17,740
Kids, now, everybody will tell me
their fathers' first and last name.

716
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,300
Okay?
-Okay.

717
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:23,740
You start.
-Mikail Elci.

718
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,859
-Nice.
-Sait Elci.

719
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,460
Alican Elci.

720
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:29,620
Gafur, stand up.

721
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,900
Cemil Elci.

722
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,140
Well done, sit down.

723
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,619
Aziz.

724
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,860
It's your turn.

725
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,820
Stand up.

726
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,379
Come on, son.

727
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,340
Tell me.

728
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,420
Come on.

729
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:19,259
Da...

730
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,419
...vut.

731
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:39,380
El...

732
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,100
...ci.

733
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:49,139
Well done, Aziz!
A round of applause!

734
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:56,140
Well done, Aziz!
Bravo! Very nice!

735
01:11:56,699 --> 01:11:58,900
Sit down.
Sit down, Aziz.

736
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:02,380
Now, write down
your fathers' names and last names.

737
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,219
Come on.

738
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,259
Welcome.

739
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,620
Chief, I see Cemilo is here,
congratulations.

740
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:17,180
Thank you, thank you.

741
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,659
Aziz was a snowy mountain
in my heart,...

742
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,460
...a mountain that had never seen
summer or spring.

743
01:12:25,499 --> 01:12:29,740
You took him under your wing.
You made us very happy.

744
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,300
Thank you.

745
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,180
Don't mention it, chief.
It's my duty.

746
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,180
He'll get even better.
-Thank you, sir.

747
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:42,340
We couldn't go to school.
At least, our kids will.

748
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,660
I hope so. They will.
Gafur misses you a lot.

749
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,060
My son...

750
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,580
Aziz...

751
01:12:56,219 --> 01:13:00,299
Well done, son. Well done.
That's my boy.

752
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,939
Let's get going.

753
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:07,019
Your mother's waiting for us.

754
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:08,540
Aziz...

755
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:10,420
How are you, Aziz?

756
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:24,059
I'm thankful for dung, Aziz.

757
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,579
If it wasn't for it,
we would be freezing.

758
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,300
Turn yourself in,
do it for us.

759
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:05,500
We wait for you day and night.
Our son grew up without a father.

760
01:14:07,139 --> 01:14:10,820
Don't let us keep worrying to death
every day.

761
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:13,060
I'm begging you, Cemilo.

762
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:17,620
Think about your parents and your
siblings, if you don't think about us.

763
01:14:19,259 --> 01:14:20,260
Cemilo...

764
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,980
Turn yourself in.

765
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:30,860
It's easy for you to say that,
so easy...

766
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,539
My going to the mountains
wasn't for nothing, was it?

767
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,340
We did so
to fight against injustice,...

768
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,500
...against crooked barons
and masters.

769
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,700
It can't go on like this.

770
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,139
It just can't.

771
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:50,459
Enough already, Cemilo.

772
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:54,899
It's been 10 years
since you went to the mountains.

773
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,540
Enough already.

774
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:22,180
Cemilo, don't ever forget
your rifle or your woman.

775
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:25,499
Whatever you do,
don't forget either of them.

776
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:30,460
Rifles and women can withstand
anything but being forgotten.

777
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,820
Father...

778
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,620
-I'm here, son. I'm here.
-I'm going to go sled.

779
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:37,859
Go!

780
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,100
Come on.

781
01:16:55,139 --> 01:16:58,340
Run, cousin, run! Maybe your mother
will bring you a beautiful woman!

782
01:16:58,379 --> 01:17:00,779
Feyzo, don't go!

783
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:04,780
Feyzo, you should settle
just like the rest of us!

784
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:10,139
Don't you know, Feyzo?

785
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:13,580
Whoever your mother brings
is going to become your wife.

786
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:18,179
Mother, I care most about the eyes.
Take a good look at them.

787
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:20,380
I want her to have blue eyes.
-Alright, alright.

788
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,380
Come on, let's go.

789
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:26,180
Remember, blue eyes!

790
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,699
-He says "blue"!
-He says he wants blue eyes!

791
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,700
You should pray
for her to have eyes.

792
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:46,940
Welcome. How are you?

793
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:48,940
Thank you, dear.

794
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,059
Take a seat.

795
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,980
She has bad breath.
-I smelled it too.

796
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:01,259
Tell me, my dear,
how many surahs does The Quran have?

797
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:03,940
99.

798
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,380
No.

799
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,979
There are 114 surahs in The Quran.

800
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,820
I'm sorry, but we can't go through
with this mariage...

801
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,539
...if she lacks knowledge of The Quran.

802
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,459
Excuse us.

803
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,179
I can see in her eyes
how graceful she is.

804
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:36,460
My husband has the same eyes.

805
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,659
Welcome. How are you?

806
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:44,300
-Who is she talking to?
-You.

807
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,620
Thank you, dear.

808
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,060
Go on, take a seat.

809
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:02,060
My dear, tell me the name
of the longest surah in The Quran.

810
01:19:03,299 --> 01:19:04,820
It's Al-Baqara.

811
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:07,900
268 verses, 50 pages.

812
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,779
God bless you!

813
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,900
She can't walk straight.

814
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:24,899
It's because of her eyes.
She's not crippled or anything.

815
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:29,099
What if she was?
It's the will of God.

816
01:19:31,019 --> 01:19:34,499
She has good knowledge of The Quran,
and she knows how to cook,...

817
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,899
...and that's all we need.

818
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,900
Congratulations.
-Thank you

819
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:41,339
-Is it done?
-It's done.

820
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,780
I wonder what the groom is like.

821
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:51,740
God bless!

822
01:20:08,459 --> 01:20:10,580
Higher. Higher.

823
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:12,700
Higher!
-Okay.

824
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:17,579
-Feyzo.
-Brother.

825
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,140
Look at that,
he tried to look like his brother.

826
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,100
-How do I look, brother?
-Feyzo.

827
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,459
You should see your bride's eyes.

828
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,020
-Really?
-Yeah.

829
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,780
May God protect her.

830
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:32,860
Dear God...

831
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,220
She's got beautiful eyes
and perfect hair.

832
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,499
She's a brunette with a slim waist,
a small nose and a decent height.

833
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,700
Her teeth are perfect,
and she has no moustache.

834
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,060
Thank God!

835
01:20:44,099 --> 01:20:46,379
She's...

836
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,460
...pretty.

837
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:53,339
-It's time, you should go.
-Come on!

838
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:29,780
Names are not important.
I can't wait any longer.

839
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:36,700
Your...

840
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:39,340
Damn my luck!

841
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,539
-Bozat?
-Yeah?

842
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:53,780
When I think my wife is looking at me,
it turns out she isn't.

843
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:57,820
When I think she's not looking at me,
it turns out she is.

844
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:00,460
Feyzo, God made her this way.

845
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,900
She can't even thread a needle.

846
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:07,420
Then you should do it!
Good God!

847
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:14,860
I can, but it breaks my heart not to
be able to look into my wife's eyes.

848
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,300
My son...

849
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:59,620
The defendant Cemil Elci is proven
guilty of murder in the first degree.

850
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,860
He is hereby sentenced to
24 years in prison,...

851
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,660
...but due to him being under
aggravated provocation...

852
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:07,460
...when committing the crime,...

853
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:11,860
...his sentence
is reduced to 4 years.

854
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:14,699
-Thank God.
-Wonderful.

855
01:23:35,099 --> 01:23:36,779
Come here.

856
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:39,940
I'll take one for the kid.

857
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,460
How much is it?

858
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,220
Here you go.
Thank you.

859
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,099
-Thank you.
-You're acquitted. Be happy, Isa.

860
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,500
Hey, Isa! Look at me!

861
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,259
Get him!

862
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,780
Get him! Get him!

863
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:09,899
There he is!

864
01:24:19,019 --> 01:24:22,139
-Thank you. You are a brave man.
-Don't mention it.

865
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:27,340
-Who are you?
-I'm Chief Davut from Palu.

866
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,739
I'm Isa from Vezri Village.
I owe you my life, sir.

867
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:37,019
There will always be a brave man
standing up to a cowardly killer.

868
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,220
This is the human duty.

869
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:43,660
-Make a wish, chief.
-Go your way. I don't wish for anything.

870
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:49,300
No, I won't leave that easily.
If it wasn't for you, I would be dead.

871
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:53,140
Go on now. Godspeed.
Be careful.

872
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:56,579
Okay.
Thank you, thank you.

873
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,700
Chief?

874
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,539
Do you have an unmarried son?

875
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:14,699
-I do have one. Why?
-And I have a daughter.

876
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:20,339
You gave me my life,
I'm giving you my daughter.

877
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,460
My son is handicapped.

878
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,900
It's okay,
as long as his heart is not.

879
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,659
Isa, think this through.
I'm telling you.

880
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,819
My son is handicapped.

881
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:42,100
Send your family for the arrangements.
My daughter is now yours.

882
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:48,020
Alright.

883
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,340
Aziz, son.

884
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,339
Aziz, son.

885
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:27,179
Now, listen to me very carefully.
Would you like to get married?

886
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:38,140
I've found a girl for you.
Your mother will go see her.

887
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:51,860
Aziz... My Aziz...

888
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:55,499
Aziz... Aziz, Aziz.

889
01:26:58,499 --> 01:27:00,220
Fa...

890
01:27:01,019 --> 01:27:02,900
...ther.

891
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,940
Mother! Aziz is coming!
Wait for him! He's coming!

892
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,379
Go, Aziz, run! Tell them
not to bring you a cross-eyed girl!

893
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,499
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude?

894
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:19,619
What's wrong with being cross-eyed?
I love my wife just the way she is.

895
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:24,299
Aziz! Tell them that you want a girl
with no beard and no mustache.

896
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:28,060
She should have perfect teeth and
perfect hair, or else, you're doomed!

897
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,500
Alright, alright. I'll bring
the most beautiful girl for you.

898
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,419
Go home, now. Go.
Go back to the house.

899
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:44,980
Go on.

900
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:52,580
Aziz, your efforts are in vain! Your
mother is picking the girl for herself!

901
01:27:56,819 --> 01:28:00,539
Can you tell us about your daughter?

902
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:03,580
Mizgin is my only daughter.

903
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:09,179
She reads The Quran, she prays.
She knows everything.

904
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:14,300
These are important, but the elders
have already agreed on marriage.

905
01:28:14,339 --> 01:28:17,300
We're here
just for the sake of tradition.

906
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:20,900
Well, my daughter is very excited today.

907
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,139
There she is.

908
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,660
Welcome, mother.

909
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,460
How are you?

910
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:00,100
Dear, go take a seat.

911
01:29:23,099 --> 01:29:27,140
Hazar, what happened?
Is something wrong?

912
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:34,820
No, no. We have dust in our eyes,
that's why we're crying.

913
01:29:42,059 --> 01:29:48,299
Mother, I know The Quran,
if you are going to ask me about it.

914
01:29:52,739 --> 01:29:54,620
My dear, it's done.

915
01:29:56,620 --> 01:30:01,979
Mother, I know how to cook too.
Would you like me to tell you about it?

916
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:08,420
Beans, chickpeas, eggplants,
baba ghanoush, pickles, casseroles,...

917
01:30:08,459 --> 01:30:15,980
...gumbo, lentils, soups, rice, pasta,
stuffed vegetables, zucchini, potatoes,

918
01:30:16,019 --> 01:30:19,259
Mother, ask, and I'll tell you
how to make it.

919
01:30:20,339 --> 01:30:23,620
My dear, we are not going to ask you
anything.

920
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:27,940
You are very smart
and very pretty.

921
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:32,620
Mother, where is the rope?

922
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:37,300
Everyone's expecting me
to get on it.

923
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:41,860
Congratulations.
It's agreed. Done.

924
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,619
Done!

925
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:51,100
Hazar,
what is our son-in-law like?

926
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:05,939
My son is handicapped.

927
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:29,339
Don't cry, don't cry.
You don't cry while getting married.

928
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:34,940
Mizgin, it's going to be okay.
Please, don't cry.

929
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:40,060
I'm newly married as well, Mizgin.
This is our home from now on, alright?

930
01:32:57,899 --> 01:33:00,340
Welcome, dear.

931
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,060
Don't cry.

932
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:17,140
This is your destiny.

933
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,020
This is your fate.

934
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:28,019
Aziz is your husband now.

935
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,940
Up until this day,
I was his mother.

936
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:40,060
From now on, you are going to be
both his mother and wife.

937
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:44,380
God has made Aziz
the way he is.

938
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:48,260
Now, when he comes in, help him.

939
01:33:48,299 --> 01:33:54,860
Take off his jacket and shirt.
Take off his shoes.

940
01:33:54,899 --> 01:34:00,059
And then, take off your clothes
and go into the bed.

941
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,219
Do you understand?

942
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:13,060
Take good care of my Aziz.

943
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:35,780
-Aziz, your wife is incredible.
-She has perfect hair.

944
01:34:35,819 --> 01:34:38,500
-She has teeth like pearls.
-She has blue eyes.

945
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,579
-She has a slim waist.
-She is tall. Wonderful.

946
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:42,740
Wonderful.

947
01:34:42,779 --> 01:34:44,660
Won...

948
01:34:44,699 --> 01:34:46,700
Don't get excited, Aziz.

949
01:34:46,739 --> 01:34:49,780
Whatever you see inside,
don't get excited.

950
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:53,339
Aziz, if you need something,
ring this bell outside the door.

951
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,379
Come on, Aziz,
don't embarrass us.

952
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,739
You are Chief Davut's son.
Go for it.

953
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,580
Aziz, when you go in,
break that bird's neck so hard...

954
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:04,700
...that she will be afraid of you
for the rest of her life.

955
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:08,819
Aziz, you know what to do inside,
don't you?

956
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:15,380
Aziz, remember what I told you.
Do exactly the same.

957
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,220
Come on, the time has come.
Come on.

958
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,220
God have mercy!

959
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:41,060
Their prayers are useless.
Aziz won't be able to do anything.

960
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:43,180
I'm sure
the girl will remain untouched.

961
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:49,139
-Who is the man?
-Aziz is the man!

962
01:36:36,059 --> 01:36:39,820
Wel...

963
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,020
Wel...

964
01:36:42,059 --> 01:36:48,539
...come.

965
01:37:26,339 --> 01:37:28,220
Help! Help!

966
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,700
Aziz, what happened?

967
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,180
He's having a seizure
from excitement.

968
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:36,820
Get him up, get him up.

969
01:37:37,739 --> 01:37:38,900
Aziz.

970
01:37:38,939 --> 01:37:40,379
Aziz?

971
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,620
He's drooling.

972
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,539
-Aziz...
-Mizgin, what happened?

973
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:47,380
I don't know.

974
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:54,100
Mizgin, anyone who saw you
would have a seizure.

975
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:56,540
It's no wonder
Aziz couldn't handle it.

976
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:01,340
Aziz, at a time like this,
one should go for it, not break down.

977
01:38:01,379 --> 01:38:05,300
Aziz, what did I tell you?
Don't get excited.

978
01:38:05,339 --> 01:38:06,659
Don't get excited.

979
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,860
-If he got excited...
-Come on, let's go.

980
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,540
-He's fine, he's fine.
-Great, he's standing up.

981
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:39,740
Come here.

982
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:51,659
Aziz, not now.
Everybody is waiting for you.

983
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:56,380
At night, okay. At night.

984
01:39:58,139 --> 01:40:00,419
Wipe your mouth
with this handkerchief.

985
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:03,580
Don't forget, okay?

986
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:09,179
Okay.

987
01:40:16,379 --> 01:40:17,860
Go on.

988
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:45,419
Hey, all! Aziz, the lion of
the mountains, has come out!

989
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:49,780
My nephew is
the lion of the village!

990
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:52,859
-Well done, Aziz!
-Well done!

991
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,379
-Aziz, congratulations!
-Congratulations!

992
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:59,099
Aziz, you are the best of us all.

993
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,539
Aziz the groom?

994
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,060
Come on over.
Welcome.

995
01:41:05,099 --> 01:41:09,899
-Well done, Aziz!
-Well done!

996
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:12,100
-What's up, Aziz?
-Come on.

997
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,580
Well done.

998
01:41:16,259 --> 01:41:19,420
-How are you, dear?
-I'm fine.

999
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:23,540
What did you do, you blushing bride?
We are all curious.

1000
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:30,140
She can't stop smiling.
I guess Aziz satisfied her well.

1001
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:34,139
Mizgin, what did you do in there
for four days?

1002
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:35,699
We talked.

1003
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:41,020
With Aziz? Yeah, yeah.
You talked, alright. We heard.

1004
01:41:43,019 --> 01:41:50,219
-Mizgin, you gave Aziz a bath.
-Yes. I gave him a bath, dressed him.

1005
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:51,779
He went to school.

1006
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:55,700
-Bless your heart.
-Amen.

1007
01:41:55,739 --> 01:41:58,780
You are heavenly.

1008
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:04,580
If something happens to me,
I won't have to worry about him.

1009
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:08,020
Mother, don't you worry.

1010
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:13,259
Aziz is my husband,
my father, my child.

1011
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,659
He's everything to me.

1012
01:42:25,019 --> 01:42:27,860
Well done. Nice.

1013
01:42:28,979 --> 01:42:32,500
That is very nice.
Nice. Well done.

1014
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:40,700
Gafur? Is that your father?
Very nice.

1015
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:53,740
Aziz, good job.
Is this your family?

1016
01:42:56,020 --> 01:43:00,380
Your mother, your father,
you and your wife.

1017
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:03,539
Are these your children?

1018
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,819
Nice.

1019
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,940
Well done, Aziz.

1020
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:14,939
Alright, kids.
You had homework to do.

1021
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:17,660
You were supposed to make
paper airplanes. Did you make them?

1022
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:22,460
Let me see your planes.
Hold them up. Hold them up.

1023
01:43:22,499 --> 01:43:24,779
Very well.
Fly them now.

1024
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:26,219
Come on!

1025
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:56,699
The flow is low here.

1026
01:43:56,740 --> 01:44:00,020
-God help that girl.
-You're right.

1027
01:44:00,059 --> 01:44:03,340
It's a shame. What is she supposed
to do with that crippled man?

1028
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,699
God forbid...

1029
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:09,659
I'd kill myself before I got married
to a pathetic man like that.

1030
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:12,020
There's filthy saliva
coming out of his mouth.

1031
01:44:12,059 --> 01:44:14,339
I'd kill myself
rather than marry him.

1032
01:44:17,339 --> 01:44:20,099
-She ran away.
-She must be upset.

1033
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:26,180
Riding a woman
is not like riding a horse.

1034
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:28,420
Did you at least find the hole?

1035
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:31,499
Your wife's beauty
is the talk of the town.

1036
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:35,060
Stop it. It's wrong.

1037
01:44:35,099 --> 01:44:37,379
Go on,
maybe you'll find the hole.

1038
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:43,979
Shame on you.
That's no way to behave.

1039
01:45:45,419 --> 01:45:50,500
Where are Aziz and his wife?
Why haven't they come for dinner?

1040
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:54,220
Father, Mizgin took the dinner
to their bedroom.

1041
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:26,579
Miz...

1042
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,740
...gin.

1043
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,659
Aziz...

1044
01:48:48,299 --> 01:48:50,339
I can't take it anymore.

1045
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,899
What's wrong, Mizgin?

1046
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:28,580
Nothing, mother.

1047
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,820
Look at Aziz.

1048
01:49:43,859 --> 01:49:47,099
-Is that Aziz? I can't see properly.
-It's him. Where is he going?

1049
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,460
Come on now.
What's this all about?

1050
01:49:52,259 --> 01:49:53,300
Aziz!

1051
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:02,380
Aziz?

1052
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,019
Aziz!

1053
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:58,460
Aziz!

1054
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,100
Aziz?

1055
01:52:01,139 --> 01:52:03,020
What are you doing there?

1056
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:07,259
Aziz?

1057
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:13,979
Aziz, please...
I'm begging you.

1058
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:16,580
Come here.
Tell me what is bothering you.

1059
01:52:18,419 --> 01:52:21,620
Come on.
Tell me, Aziz.

1060
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:41,180
Alright, then.
If you jump, I jump too.

1061
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:44,380
Go on, jump.

1062
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:50,939
Are you crying?

1063
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:53,500
You are going to write down
what is bothering you,...

1064
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,540
...and I'm going to read it.
I'm going to find you a solution.

1065
01:52:56,579 --> 01:53:00,100
Just don't be sad, don't cry.
Okay?

1066
01:53:02,099 --> 01:53:07,580
Aziz, my brother...
Please, come with me.

1067
01:53:07,619 --> 01:53:09,220
Come on, Aziz.

1068
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:12,140
Come on. Come.

1069
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:13,660
Come.

1070
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,459
Trust me.

1071
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:22,379
Come on.
My brother... Come.

1072
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:25,060
Aziz! What happened?

1073
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,460
Nothing. All is well.

1074
01:53:31,859 --> 01:53:33,299
Thank you.

1075
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:35,819
Aziz is not at school today.
Why?

1076
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:38,020
Father, is he sick or what?

1077
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:40,739
Go and look.
Go get him.

1078
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:43,780
Now, I am going to give you
your report cards.

1079
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:46,979
Kids, come on, let's go to class.
Slowly, slowly.

1080
01:55:49,499 --> 01:55:50,699
Aziz?

1081
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,700
Aziz?

1082
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:13,940
Father!

1083
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:18,179
Father! Father!

1084
01:56:19,379 --> 01:56:23,860
Neither Aziz nor his wife are here.
They left this letter. They are gone.

1085
01:56:27,059 --> 01:56:30,980
"Before I start my letter,
I greet you all.

1086
01:56:31,019 --> 01:56:35,900
I give my regards to my elders,
my love to the younger ones.

1087
01:56:35,939 --> 01:56:42,500
I know, you'll all be sad,
but I had to go.

1088
01:56:42,539 --> 01:56:45,460
Nobody has ever understood me,
listened to me.

1089
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:53,380
Mom, dad, I would have given my all
to talk to you, but I couldn't.

1090
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:55,180
Forgive me.

1091
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:01,379
Everybody in the village
mocked me for years...

1092
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:04,100
...for not talking,
for being disabled.

1093
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:06,500
It was okay.

1094
01:57:07,499 --> 01:57:14,780
But now, I'm 31 years old.
I have a wife.

1095
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:18,500
It's too difficult for me to watch
the villagers harass my wife.

1096
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:22,139
I'm not leaving for myself,
but for my wife.

1097
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:29,300
Maybe they won't make fun of me
where I go.

1098
01:57:30,419 --> 01:57:35,500
Don't you worry about us.
I am going to come back one day.

1099
01:57:36,059 --> 01:57:38,620
I love you all very much.

1100
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:43,060
Please give me your blessings."
-God bless you.

1101
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:49,780
"Take good care of my horse,
and may God take good care of you."

1102
01:58:08,939 --> 01:58:10,619
Go on.

1103
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:37,820
I'll be a teacher too
when I grow up.

1104
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:30,340
I don't know
when I'll be back again.

1105
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:35,500
I won't forget you or all the things
you've done for me...

1106
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:36,980
...until the day I die.

1107
01:59:37,019 --> 01:59:41,140
What brave,
courageous people you are...

1108
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:43,460
You welcomed me into your lives.

1109
01:59:43,499 --> 01:59:46,940
Your wives taught me to make
cow patties out of dung,...

1110
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:48,940
...so that I wouldn't get cold.

1111
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:53,740
Haydar.

1112
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:57,020
I'm not afraid of the bandits
anymore.

1113
01:59:58,019 --> 02:00:02,579
Those brave men
helped build the school.

1114
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:06,539
These kids...

1115
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:08,860
Listen to me, kids.

1116
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:13,499
If I live long enough, I will see them
continue their education.

1117
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:17,099
Some will be engineers,
some will be doctors,...

1118
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:19,499
...some will be teachers.

1119
02:00:34,859 --> 02:00:40,220
This is Aziz's report card,
and the picture he drew.

1120
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:56,140
I have six sons.

1121
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:00,260
You've become the seventh one.

1122
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:04,420
I can't talk anymore.

1123
02:01:06,179 --> 02:01:09,500
Go on now. Go, go.

1124
02:01:11,459 --> 02:01:14,620
-With your blessings, I'm leaving.
-Goodbye.

1125
02:01:24,179 --> 02:01:25,820
Mahir, son.

1126
02:01:28,739 --> 02:01:30,260
Yes, Father Davut.

1127
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:35,660
I was going to ask you
about Aziz, but...

1128
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,300
...I won't.

1129
02:01:44,699 --> 02:01:46,700
Have a safe journey.

1130
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:26,660
7 years later

1131
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:53,980
There's a car coming.

1132
02:02:55,379 --> 02:02:59,699
Father, there's a car coming!

1133
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,420
There's a car coming!

1134
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:04,340
Where is it coming from?

1135
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:16,580
-Whose car is it?
-It's beautiful.

1136
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:21,539
I wonder who it is.

1137
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:23,180
Is it the mayor?

1138
02:03:29,339 --> 02:03:31,979
I have never seen
a car like this before.

1139
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:43,420
I can't see. Who are they?

1140
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:48,539
It's Mr. Mahir!

1141
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:57,299
-Welcome.
-Welcome, teacher.

1142
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:59,420
Welcome, teacher.

1143
02:03:59,459 --> 02:04:00,860
Welcome, dear.

1144
02:04:00,899 --> 02:04:04,100
-Mahir, son... Welcome.
-Thank you. How are you?

1145
02:04:04,139 --> 02:04:05,939
-Thank you.
-This is my wife.

1146
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,020
-Welcome, dear.
-Thank you.

1147
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:15,500
Everyone, I love your hair
and your moustaches.

1148
02:04:15,539 --> 02:04:18,100
Wonderful!
-Wonderful.

1149
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:19,700
Come on, let's go inside.

1150
02:04:19,739 --> 02:04:23,260
Hold on, Haydar.
All of you, stop.

1151
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:26,540
Do you know
who I brought with me?

1152
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:01,420
Aziz, is that you, son?

1153
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,419
It's me, father.

1154
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:12,940
Aziz, you can talk.
Thank God.

1155
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:14,819
I can talk, mother.

1156
02:07:23,579 --> 02:07:27,419
I've missed you all so much...
-We've missed you too.

1157
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:34,139
You're all better now.
Did you have surgery?

1158
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:40,060
No, father. I...
